As consultant, I specialize in the field of Organizational Change & Transformation. During the beginning of 2003, I have developed the Pendula Model&#8482;, which is a revolutionary tool in the field of change management 

The Pendula Model&#8482; is strategic in nature and have assisted many organisations to increase the speed at which they can implement change and transformation on a constant basis, whilst minimising the impact of employee resistance.
Most of my major consulting assignments have been done in South Africa, for companies such as; Goldfield Mines, South African Police Service, Department of Land Affairs, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Department of Justice, Vodacom, Grintek Telekom, Kumba Resources, and many more. Not all my consulting assignments were related to the field of change and transformation, but as time passed, it became my field of specialisation. 
Training:
I believe that effective training can make a significant difference within organisations. In order to do this, your employees will need more than just training. They will need inspiration and the belief that they can go out there and make a significant difference with their newfound knowledge, skill and mind-set.","","0027 12 567 2824","hello@derekhendrikz.com, derek@derekhendrikz.com","","http://www.derekhendrikz.com/"
